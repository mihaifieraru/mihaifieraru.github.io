However, most of the existing models focus on analyzing a single person in isolation, and those who process several people focus largely on resolving multi-person data association, rather than inferring interactions. This may lead to incorrect, lifeless 3d estimates, that miss the subtle human contact aspects--the essence of the event--and are of little use for detailed behavioral understanding. This paper addresses such issues and makes several contributions: (1) we introduce models for interaction signature estimation (ISP) encompassing contact detection, segmentation, and 3d contact signature prediction; (2) we show how such components can be leveraged in order to produce augmented losses that ensure contact consistency during 3d reconstruction; (3) we construct several large datasets for learning and evaluating 3d contact prediction and reconstruction methods; specifically, we introduce CHI3D, a lab-based accurate 3d motion capture dataset with 631 sequences containing 2,525 contact events, 728,664 ground truth 3d poses, as well as FlickrCI3D, a dataset of 11,216 images, with 14,081 processed pairs of people, and 81,233 facet-level surface correspondences within 138,213 selected contact regions. Finally, (4) we present models and baselines to illustrate how contact estimation supports meaningful 3d reconstruction where essential interactions are captured.

Despite the large improvements in human pose estimation enabled by the development of convolutional neural networks, there still exist a lot of difficult cases where even the state-of-the-art models fail to correctly localize all body joints. This motivates the need for an additional refinement step that addresses these challenging cases and can be easily applied on top of any existing method. In this work, we introduce a pose refinement network (PoseRefiner) which takes as input both the image and a given pose estimate and learns to directly predict a refined pose by jointly reasoning about the input-output space. In order for the network to learn to refine incorrect body joint predictions, we employ a novel data augmentation scheme for training, where we model “hard“ human pose cases. We evaluate our approach on four popular large-scale pose estimation benchmarks such as MPII Single- and Multi-Person Pose Estimation, PoseTrack Pose Estimation, and PoseTrack Pose Tracking, and report systematic improvement over the state of the art.","tags":null,"title":"Learning to Refine Human Pose Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mihai Fieraru"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"14c17958bd806df1f766296d966a2d2a","permalink":"https://mihaifieraru.github.io/publication/mihaifierarumscthesis/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mihaifierarumscthesis/","section":"publication","summary":"This thesis addresses the multi-person tracking task with two types of representation: body pose and segmentation mask. We explore these scenarios in the semi-supervised setting, where one available annotation is available per person during test time. More complex representations of people (segmentation mask and body pose) can provide richer understanding of visual scenes, and methods that leverage supervision during test time should be developed for the cases when supervision is available. We propose HumanMaskTracker for the task of semi-supervised multi-person mask tracking. Our approach builds on recent techniques proposed for the task of video object segmentation. These include the mask refinement approach, training with syn- thetic data, fine-tuning per object and leveraging optical flow. In addition, we propose leveraging instance semantic segmentation proposals to give the tracker a better notion about the human class. Moreover, we propose modeling people occlusions inside the data synthesis process to make the tracker more robust to the challenges of occlusion and disocclusion. For the task of semi-supervised multi-person pose tracking, we propose the method HumanPoseTracker. We show that the task of multi-person pose tracking can benefit significantly from using one pose supervision per track during test time. Fine-tuning per object and leveraging optical flow, techniques proposed for the task of video object segmentation, prove to be highly effective for supervised pose tracking as well. Also, we propose a technique to remove false positive joint detections and develop tracking stopping criteria. A promising application of our work is presented by extending the method to generate dense from sparse annotations in videos.","tags":null,"title":"Learning to Track Humans in Videos","type":"publication"}]
